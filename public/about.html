<h1>/about me</h1>
<p>I'm currently a College Student studying for a Bachelors in Computer Science at Hunter College in NYC and working for a IT team under CUNY at Bronx Community College as an IT assistant.</p>
<p>Here are some of the technologies I've become familiar with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML & CSS</li>
  <li>Javascript ES6+</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>React.js</li>
  <li>C#</li>
</ul>

<p>When I have spare time I spend it as a calisthenics athlete training to do planche leans and gives hours of my life to Cyberpunk 2077. Also being a foodie.</p>
